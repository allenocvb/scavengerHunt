## Overview
(Dev in progress)
Scavenger App is a mobile application that gamifies task completion through photo verification and location tracking. Users interact with a list of predefined tasks, completing them by attaching geotagged photos. The app then visualizes task locations on an interactive map. I started building this application in my iOS 102 class as part of the CodePath Curriculum. Plan on expanding features.

## Features
- Task Management: Display and interact with a list of predefined tasks
- Photo Integration: Capture and attach photos to mark tasks as complete
- Geolocation: Automatically tag task completion locations
- Map Visualization: View completed task locations on an interactive map
- Camera Integration: Built-in camera functionality for seamless photo capture
- Real-time Updates: Instant task status updates on the home screen

## Technologies Used
- Swift
- UIKit
- MapKit
- Core Location
- AVFoundation (for camera functionality)
